# MiniSpec: new feature

Create a temporal feature document under `.minispec/features/`.

## Steps

1. Read `.minispec/README.md` to honor the standard (writing rules, formats).
2. Read the template `.minispec/templates/feature.md`.
3. Derive a kebab-case slug for the feature (e.g. `github-sync`). The file is
   `.minispec/features/<slug>.md`. If it already exists, update it instead of
   overwriting blindly.
4. Fill the four sections (Goal / Context / Changes / Acceptance):
   - **Goal** — one sentence.
   - **Context** — current state: what exists, what's missing, why now.
   - **Changes** — short bullet list of the work.
   - **Acceptance** — observable done conditions.
5. Base content on the real code and the user's description. Don't invent.
6. Open its GitHub issue, always, one per feature, in the repo the feature file is in
   (`gh issue create -R <owner>/<repo>`): title and body in Spanish, for someone who
   uses the project (what and why, not the file's wording), label `feature` (create it
   with `gh label create feature` if the repo lacks it), and a last line pointing to
   `.minispec/features/<slug>.md`. Then link the file to it: a line `Issue: [#N](<issue URL>)`
   right under the file's title. Give the user the issue's URL.

## Rules

- Max 100 lines. Short sentences and lists. No filler.
- This is TEMPORAL knowledge: describe work in progress only.
- Reminder for later: when the feature is done, promote anything permanent it
  revealed (a decision → ADR, a rule → conventions, a term → glossary) and then
  DELETE the feature file. Mention this to the user; do not delete now.
- Its issue is closed when the feature is implemented (see `minispec-implement`).
