# MiniSpec: new bugfix

Document a bug and its fix using the bugfix format. It is temporal knowledge, so
it lives under `.minispec/features/`.

## Steps

1. Read `.minispec/README.md` for the standard.
2. Read the template `.minispec/templates/bugfix.md`.
3. Create `.minispec/features/fix-<slug>.md` with `<slug>` in kebab-case.
4. Fill the four sections:
   - **Problem** — observable symptom.
   - **Cause** — root cause.
   - **Solution** — what was changed.
   - **Verification** — how the fix was confirmed.
5. Open its GitHub issue, always, one per note, in the repo the note is in: title and
   body in Spanish (the symptom as the user sees it, and the cause), label `fix`
   (`gh label create fix` if the repo lacks it), and a last line pointing to
   `.minispec/features/fix-<slug>.md`. When the fix is committed, close it as
   `minispec-implement` says (`Closes #N` in the commit, then the summary comment).

## Rules

- Max 100 lines. Short and factual. Base it on the real diff.
- Temporal: once the fix is merged and verified, delete this file. If the fix
  revealed a permanent lesson (a rule, a decision), promote it to `core/` or an
  ADR first. Mention this; do not delete now.
